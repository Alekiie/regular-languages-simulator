# DFA Simulator

## TODO

- [x] Deploy (Vercel)
- [x] Implement the core DFA logic
- [x] Saving and loading DFA to/from JSON
- [x] Drawing DFA into page
- [x] Simulating DFA from UI
- [x] Creating DFA from UI textual (direct json)
- [x] Basic UI (React)
- [x] Creating DFA from UI textual (table ui)
- [x] Turn DFA into NFA
- [x] Simulating NFA from UI
- [x] Creating NFA from UI textual (table ui)
- [x] Make it so that if there are multiple transitions from one state to another, the link label is shown as a list of symbols
- [x] Add ability to convert NFA into DFA
- [x] Add ability to minimize DFA
- [x] Add ability to minimally and consistently relabel DFA (equivalent DFAs get the same relabeling)
- [x] Add ability to check equivalence of two NFAs
- [x] Add ability to convert regex into NFA
- [ ] Add ability to convert NFA into regex
- [ ] Saving and loading DFA/NFA from database (Vercel Postgres)
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Add ability to stop forces and fix DFA/NFA
- [ ] Links unnaturally keep flipping around, fix that
- [ ] Add ability to pan and zoom window (will need to slightly modify the force layout)

Likely will abandon in favour of table based UI (simpler and might be more practical anyway)

- [ ] Creating DFA/NFA from UI drag and drop
- [ ] Editing DFA/NFA from UI
